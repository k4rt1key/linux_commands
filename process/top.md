### Manipulate view of the display

```bash 
top 
```

During monitoring of process which commands do what...

* P => Sort process by CPU usage 
* M => Sort process by memory usage
* N => Sort process by PID
* T => Sort process by running time
* k => kill process ( after pressing k we are prompted to enter PID )
* r => Re-nice process ( after pressing r we are prompted to enter PID and it's new priority )
* u => Display process for specific user 

        ```bash
        top -u kartikey
        ```

* c => Toggle between command name and full command
* i => Toggle between show idle process or not
* s => Change update interval
* 1 => Toggle between show stats for all individual CPU OR overall CPU usage
* d => Same as s 

### Gives update for 3 times then exit

```bash
top -n 3
```

### Redirects output into specified file 

```bash
top -b > logs.txt
```


### Sorts output result 

```bash
top -o %CPU %MEM ...
```

### How to add or remove col 

```
top
```

* Press `f`
* Choose col 
* Press `d` to add/remove that col from display

### How to change unit of memory

```bash
export TOPMEM=M
```

or 

```bash
export TOPMEM=G
```
