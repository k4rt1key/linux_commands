# Autonomous_system

- collection of networks that are all managed, controlled and supervised by a single entity or organization
- An autonomous system (AS) is a very large network or group of networks with a **single routing policy.** Each AS is assigned a **unique ASN**, which is a number that identifies the AS.
- Autonomous system (AS) is a large network or group of networks that has a unified routing policy. 
- Range of ip addresses that a given **AS** has control over called their **ip address space**
- **ASN** = of 16 bit
- An AS has to meet certain qualifications before the governing bodies that assign ASNs will give it a number. It must have a distinct routing policy, be of a certain size, and have more than one connection to other ASes. There is a limited amount of ASNs available, and if they were given out too freely, the supply would run out and routing would become much more complex.
